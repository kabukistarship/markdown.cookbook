### Selecting a License

To publish or share your book you need to select a license based on how you want to monetize your Writings and Discoveries. Creative Commons license is a good choice for many works but you may want to sell you works. Markdown Cookbook recommends using the [Kabuki Licenses](https://github.com/KabukiStarship/KabukiLicenses), which has four licenses, two for open-source and two for closed source. This document by default uses the [Kabuki Strong Source-available License](https://github.com/KabukiStarship/KabukiLicenses/blob/master/LicenseSourceAvailableStrong.md) which is intended for people who want to have a free open-source version of their book with paid print copies and optional alternative income methods like paid member websites with member's only videos.
